          <p>
            In what was a repeat of the 2003 Premiership decider, red hot
            favourites Morningside took on the fast-finishing Mount Gravatt in
            the battle of Brisbane's South-East. Both clubs entered with that
            winning feel about them with neither having lost in the previous two
            months to September 2009. Morningside entered fresh and desperate to
            amend for the previous years fade out.
