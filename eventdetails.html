            In the Seniors, it was a repeat of the 2003 Premiership decider, red
            hot favourites Morningside took on the fast-finishing Mount Gravatt
            in the battle of Brisbane's South-East. Both clubs entered with that
            winning feel about them with neither having lost in the previous two
            months to September 2009. Morningside entered fresh and desperate to
            amend for the previous years fade out. Backed all year long by a
            plethora of depth across Reserve Grade and Under 18's, the club was
            able to achieve the rare feat of complete Senior Club Win, something
            unfathomable in today's football era. An effort that shows the true
            character and incaptulates the formidable Morningside Panther
            Spirit.

            planned at the club yet, but watch this space as more information
            comes to light. Will most likely be covering a few kegs for the
            Premiership alumni.
